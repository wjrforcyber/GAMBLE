# GAMBLE

This is a WIP case study related to maze route.

## Build

You probably need to deal with `toolchain.cmake` first, I encode it with the CUDA toolset on our server. Then simply type
```bash
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake
cmake --build build
cd build
```
to build the whole project. To run all test cases, type
```bash
ctest --verbose --output-on-failure
```
